# File-Reader
I was given like an eight paragraph essay to read for my class. I didn't really feel like reading it, but I wanted to know what the essay said. Laziness inspires creativity, so I wrote a small text-to-speech script that parses a txt file and reads it to me. Enjoy!

If you couldn't tell, I have absolutely no error checking in my source code so it is imperative that the user makes sure the txt file is named correctly and is formatted in a way that the tts package can read it. I will be adding all of the error checking later on, but I made this in like 6 or 7 minutes lol
